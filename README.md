# Responsive Web Design Certification

You will learn the languages used by developers to create webpages in this Responsive Web Design Certification: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

To start, you'll master the fundamentals of HTML and CSS by creating a cat photo app. Eventually, you will construct a penguin to learn about current approaches like CSS variables, and a quiz site to learn about best standards for accessibility.

Lastly, you will learn how to create responsive webpages by using CSS Grid to create a magazine article layout and Flexbox to build a photo gallery.
